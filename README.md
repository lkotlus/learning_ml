### I'm in the process of learning about ML
- It's very interesting!
- What I've done so far:
    - Worked using the scikit-learn library
        - Regression algorithms
            1. Linear Regression
            2. Polynomial Regression
            3. KNN
        - Classification algorithms:
            1. K-Means
            2. Logistic Regression
            3. SVM
    - Implemented an algorithm from scratch (I'd like to do some more, though)
        - K-Means with an enhanced initial guessing algorithm. Not quite as good as K-Means++, but much better than random guesses.
